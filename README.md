How to test it:

1) Create a shortcut from tslgame to desktop "\PUBG\TslGame\Binaries\Win64"
2) Open properties of the shortcut and add in target box this line (-LobbyUrl="http://localhost/index.html") 
3) Download an apache server "Like ngix or xampp" and extract the html in the correct folder "ex. ngix/html"
4) Start the server and start the shortcut!

Enjoy!!

Note: The STEAM Initialitation failed error can be bypassed in the file main.js, inside this file you can fix this error and see the core of the lobby!
